# Campus Navigation and Utility Planner

## Problem Statement
The Campus Navigation and Utility Planner is a software solution that models university buildings, optimizes navigation routes, and plans utility layouts efficiently. It uses **trees** and **graph algorithms** to store and retrieve building data, navigate campus locations, and optimize resources. The system simulates real-world campus scenarios to help students and staff plan their routes and utilities efficiently.

## Objectives
- Learn **C++/Python** programming with practical **trees** and **graphs** implementation.  
- Gain experience with **binary search trees**, **AVL trees**, and **graph representations**.  
- Implement algorithms for **campus navigation**, **utility layout planning**, and **expression evaluation**.  
- Apply **tree traversals**, **shortest path algorithms**, and **minimum spanning tree algorithms**.  
- Evaluate arithmetic expressions using **expression trees**.

## Features
- **Building Data Storage:** Using **BST and AVL trees** for efficient retrieval.  
- **Campus Location Listing:** Inorder, preorder, and postorder **tree traversals**.  
- **Graph Representation:** Represent campus paths using adjacency matrix/list.  
- **Optimal Navigation:** Find shortest paths using **Dijkstra’s algorithm**.  
- **Utility Planning:** Plan cost-effective cable layouts with **Kruskal’s algorithm**.  
- **Expression Evaluation:** Compute energy bills using **expression trees**.

## Implementation Steps
1. Design **Building Data ADT** with attributes:
   - `BuildingID` (Integer)
   - `BuildingName` (String)
   - `LocationDetails` (String)
   - `Connections` (Graph edges with weights)
2. Implement **BST and AVL trees** to store building data.  
3. Develop **tree traversal methods** to list campus locations.  
4. Construct **graphs** for campus paths and implement:
   - **Dijkstra’s algorithm** for shortest path
   - **Kruskal’s algorithm** for MST
5. Implement **expression trees** for arithmetic computations.

## Learning Outcomes
- Apply tree and graph algorithms to practical campus navigation scenarios.  
- Understand binary search trees, AVL trees, graph traversal, and expression trees in real-world applications.  
- Implement **shortest path** and **minimum spanning tree** algorithms efficiently.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of **trees** and **graphs**.  
- Familiarity with **recursive algorithms** in C++ or Python.  
- Understanding of **graph representations** (adjacency list/matrix).
